# edit-descriptions
This command allows editing (adding or modifying) descriptions in `annotations.json` which is a part of internal database entry. Requires the following arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ---------- |
| `--entry_id` (string) | entry ID in internal database, corresponding to the entry folder name (e.g. `emd-1832`) |
| `--source_db` (string) | source database, corresponding to the source database folder name in internal database (e.g. `emdb`)|
| `--db_path` (string) | specifies the path to the internal database |
| `--data_json_path` (string) | specifies path to JSON file with descriptions. This file represents a list of objects, each of which follow a specific data model (see diagram below). An example of such file is provided under the schema. |
